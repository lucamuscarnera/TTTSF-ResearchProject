# Research Project
Research Project based on the paper *Towards Transparent Timeseries Forecasting*


# Abstract

The  following repository contains the code that was  used to produce the research project report. It includes, moreover, the python
modules that I developed to provide an interface to JAX which was used to implement almost every deep learning and optimization algorithm mentioned
in my work.


# Structure of the repository

The repository is mainly divided into ```libs```  and ```experiments```. The first folder contains the modules while the second contains the experimments
that I mentioned in the paper. The experiments cover different topics, providing empirical support to the structure of the paper.

To run a python script is sufficient to run in bash

```
cd foldername
conda run --no-capture-output python3 -u ./scriptname.py arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
```

Some scripts require a list of argument to run. Please refer to the README file in each  folder
